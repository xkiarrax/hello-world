This is my very first Repo. Learning the ropes!
# About Kiarra
I am a web and graphic designer. I know html, javascript, and css. I have been weary of learning Github for quite some time now. However, I've decided I can't hold off any longer. So I've taken the plunge. I've done it. I've decided to learn it! Wish me luck. None of this makes very much sense right now, but hopefully that will change.
